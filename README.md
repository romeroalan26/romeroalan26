- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Alan Romero and I'm from the Dominican Republic. I'm excited to pursue a career as a web developer and put my programming skills to use in a professional setting. I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I've honed through various projects and personal pursuits. I believe that the ability to create visually appealing and functional websites is a crucial aspect of modern business, and I'm eager to contribute to that field.
